# Genesis as a Plugin

## Warning: This plugin is for testing purposes only!

This repository is a proof of concept demonstrating how the Genesis Framework can work if it were converted to a plugin.

See the [Genesis Parent Theme](https://github.com/seothemes/genesis-parent-theme) for a compatible parent theme.

## Notes

This plugin is based on the Genesis Framework parent theme but a lot of the original files have been stripped out for simplicity.
