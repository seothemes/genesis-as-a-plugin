## [3.1.2] - 2019-09-05

### Fixed
* Prevent the block editor and Genesis sidebar failing to load if a custom post type supports `genesis-layouts` but not `custom-fields`.
* Find 'Â© 2019' in stored footer text and replace it with the `[footer_copyright]` shortcode during the Genesis update process. This is designed to ensure that the copyright year in footer text updates in future years.
