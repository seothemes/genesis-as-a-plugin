## [3.1.1] - 2019-08-29

### Added
* Add a new genesis-breadcrumbs-visible body class if breadcrumbs are visible on a page.
* Add new genesis-singular-image-visible body class to allow styling of pages if a featured image appears on them.

### Changed
* Add the genesis-breadcrumbs-hidden body class if breadcrumbs are disabled for the current page type. (Previously this was only applied if breadcrumbs were active but hidden using “hide breadcrumbs”.)
* Do not emit genesis-singular-image-hidden body class if unsupported by current post type.
* Hide Custom Classes panel in the Genesis sidebar if the current post type is not public.
* Hide Breadcrumbs panel in the new Genesis editor sidebar if a theme opts to disable support for Genesis breadcrumbs.
* Hide Genesis sidebar if no panels will display.

### Fixed
* Fix an issue where heading levels would change for static homepages on sites using SEO plugins.
* Fix an issue where changes to Genesis sidebar settings would fail to save if the Easy Digital Downloads plugin was in use.
* Prevent the Genesis sidebar from appearing on posts that do not support custom-fields.
